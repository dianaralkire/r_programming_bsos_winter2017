# 1. Run t-tests with the "iris" data set
#    - compare sepal width
#    - all three pairwise comparisons (i.e., between the three species)

# 2. Find the overall correlation between Sepal.Length and Petal.Length

# 3. Get the correlation between Sepal.Length and Petal.Length for each Species
#    separately

# 4. Look at the built-in data set ToothGrowth. Use a t-test to compare tooth
#    lengths in the different supplement types.

# 5. Re-run #4 t-test as a true "Student's" t-test, not a Welch. Re-run it again
#    as a paired t-test.
#    HINT: read the help file carefully!

# 6. Run a Wilcoxon Signed Rank test for the same comparisons in #1
#    - use help.search to find a function to do this

# 7. Save all results (and only those results!) in an
#    .RData object
#    - try to think of (at least) two ways to do this

# 8. Clean, comment, and save this script with your answers

# 9. Look at the format of your Homework data set
#     - find a function to read in your data
#     - needed for tonight's Homework
